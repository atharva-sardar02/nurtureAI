# Base Project Rules

## Description
Core rules for NurtureAI project development

## Project Overview
AI-powered parent onboarding system for Daybreak Health using React, Firebase, OpenAI, and Pinecone.

## Key Principles
1. **Empathy First** - Every interaction should be supportive
2. **Security** - HIPAA considerations, data privacy, secure Firebase rules
3. **Testing** - Write tests alongside features, not after
4. **Documentation** - Update Memory Bank when making decisions
5. **Code Quality** - Follow ESLint/Prettier, use functional components

## Technology Stack
- React 18+ with Vite
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- Pinecone (RAG vector database)
- React Router v6
- React Context API for state

## File Structure
- Components organized by feature
- Services for API clients and business logic
- Hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Utils for helper functions

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Integration tests for Firebase/API
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests for critical paths
