# NurtureAI - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is an AI-powered parent onboarding system for Daybreak Health. The project uses React, Firebase, OpenAI API, and Pinecone for RAG functionality.

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default exports for utilities
- Use async/await over promises
- Follow React best practices (hooks rules, component composition)
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

## File Organization
- Components in `src/components/` organized by feature
- Services in `src/services/` for API clients and business logic
- Hooks in `src/hooks/` for reusable stateful logic
- Utils in `src/utils/` for helper functions
- Contexts in `src/contexts/` for global state

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ChatInterface.jsx`)
- Services: camelCase (e.g., `openai.js`)
- Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useAuth.js`)
- Utils: camelCase (e.g., `dateHelpers.js`)

## Testing
- Write tests alongside features
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Integration tests for Firebase and API interactions
- Component tests using React Testing Library

## Firebase
- Use Firestore for database
- Implement security rules for all collections
- Use Firebase Auth for authentication
- Use Firebase Storage for file uploads

## AI Integration
- OpenAI API for conversational AI
- Pinecone for RAG vector search
- Implement error handling and fallbacks
- Cache embeddings when possible

## Data Privacy
- 90-day conversation retention
- User-triggered data deletion
- HIPAA considerations for sensitive data
- Never log PII

## Documentation
- Update Memory Bank files when making architectural decisions
- Comment complex logic
- Keep PRD and task list updated
